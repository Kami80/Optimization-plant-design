üéØ Economic Objective Functions in Refinery and Society
This project is about understanding how we can use different economic objective functions to make smart decisions ‚Äî both in society and in industries like oil refineries.

An economic objective function helps us decide how to use resources in the best way to meet people's needs and goals. Different countries or companies may choose different goals depending on their values, situation, and future plans.

üí° Common Economic Objectives
Here are some common goals societies and governments may focus on:

Economic Growth: Making more goods and services to improve people's lives.

Balanced Development: Making sure no group or region is left behind.

Social Justice: Reducing income inequality and giving equal opportunities to everyone.

Environmental Sustainability: Protecting nature and resources for the future.

Economic Stability: Avoiding big ups and downs in the economy.

Human Development: Improving education, healthcare, and living conditions.

Different places may use a mix of these goals, and they can change over time.

üõ¢Ô∏è Economic Objectives in Oil Refineries
In oil refineries, we often use two main types of economic objectives:

1. Cost Function
The goal is to reduce costs and work more efficiently. This includes things like energy use, equipment maintenance, labor, and production costs.

2. Profit Function
Here, the focus is on making the most profit. That means increasing income from selling products, reducing costs, and improving performance.

‚öôÔ∏è Why It Matters
Choosing the right economic objective depends on many things:

Oil prices

Global market demand

Technology

Environmental laws

Competition

Sustainability and long-term planning are also becoming more important in modern economic decisions.

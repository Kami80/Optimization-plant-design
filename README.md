# üéØ Economic Objective Functions in Society and Oil Refineries

This project explores how different **economic objective functions** can help guide better decision-making in both **society** and **industrial systems** like **oil refineries**.

An **economic objective function** is basically a tool that helps decide how to use resources (money, energy, people, etc.) in the best way to achieve certain goals. These goals can change based on what a country or company values most ‚Äî such as growth, fairness, or sustainability.

## üåç Common Economic Objectives in Society

Here are some typical goals that societies or governments might focus on:

  Increasing national production and income to improve living standards.

- **Balanced Development**  
  Making sure all parts of the economy grow fairly, avoiding big gaps between groups.

- **Social Justice**  
  Reducing inequality in income and giving equal opportunities to everyone.

- **Environmental Sustainability**  
  Protecting natural resources so future generations can live well too.

- **Economic Stability**  
  Keeping the economy stable over time, avoiding large ups and downs.

- **Human Development**  
  Improving things like education, health, and quality of life.

Each country may use a combination of these goals, depending on their local and global situation.

## üõ¢Ô∏è Economic Objectives in Oil Refineries

In oil refineries, we usually focus on these two main goals:

### 1. Cost Function  
The goal here is to **reduce operational costs** and increase efficiency. This includes:
- Equipment maintenance
- Energy use
- Labor costs
- Material usage

### 2. Profit Function  
The focus here is on **maximizing profit** by:
- Increasing revenue from selling products
- Lowering production costs
- Improving production and marketing strategies

Choosing the right function depends on factors like:
- Oil prices  
- Global demand and supply  
- Technology used  
- Environmental and legal rules  
- Competition in the market
